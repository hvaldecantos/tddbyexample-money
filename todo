To do list:

5 USD + 10 CHF = 10 USD if CHF:USD is 2:1
done => 5 USD * 2 = 10 USD
done => 5 CHF * 2 = 10 CHF

Smells:

done => Make "amount" private
done => Dollar side-effects?
Money rounding?
done => object equality => def ==
object equality nil => def ==
object hash code => def hash
Dollar/Franc duplication
done => common equality
done => common times
done => Francs != Dollars
done => need of currency?
delete test franc multiplication?
